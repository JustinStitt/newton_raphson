# newton_raphson

 In numerical analysis, Newton's method, 
 also known as the Newtonâ€“Raphson method, 
 named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, 
 is a root-finding algorithm which produces 
 successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.
 
 This is implemented in c++.
